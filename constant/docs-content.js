              Wasiat is a declaration of a person made during his lifetime with
              respect to his physical and digital assets, to be carried out for
              the purpose of distribution, charity or for any other purpose
              permissible by Islamic Law, after demise. With a Wasiat, you are
              able to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                List down your assets and wishes as to how to deal with the
                assets either to be terminated, liquidated, transferred or
                distributed based on Faraid.
              </li>
              <li>
                To remunerate persons in conducting specific tasks stipulated in
                the Wasiat, e.g. terminate account, pay Zakat due etc.

                individual or corporation, authorised by you to deal with your
                assets and should be experienced, independent, trustworthy and
                impartial so as to ensure proper administration and distribution
                of your estate
              </li>
              <li>
                Appoint the Guardian of your minor children (below 18 years of
                age) or special child. The Guardian will be the primary
                caretaker of your children who's responsible for their
                well-being
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure that the distribution of your estate will be fast and
                efficient, as there are fewer formalities, thus avoiding
                possible erosion of the value of your estate.

            <p>
              For non-Muslims in Malaysia, the distribution of assets and
              execution of final wishes through a Will becomes effective after
              their passing. This allows for personal choice in asset
              distribution, requiring only that the individual be of legal age
              and mentally competent when making the Will. An appointed executor
              manages the estate according to the Will's instructions after the
              individual's passing, ensuring assets are allocated as desired.

              Sampul allows you to list your digital or physical assets,

              a deceased's estate among beneficiaries based on the Quran and

              one person to another without compensation, operational while the
              giver is alive or after passing. In Malaysia, it's a key part of
              Islamic estate planning, ensuring assets smoothly transition to
              beneficiaries.
            </p>
            <p>In Arabic, Hibah is translated as a gift.</p>

            <p>
              Nazar is a vow made to Allah to perform certain actions if certain
              conditions are met. For example: “I wish to go for Umrah if I have
              a son.” Umrah is compulsory if a son was borned and if he/she does
              not have the chance to do it while still alive, his/her
              beneficiaries are obliged to do it on tbeneficiary behalf and the
              expenses can be taken from one’s estate.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the beneficiaries are unable to perform the nazar, they may opt
              for a kaffarah or fidyah if it is a nazar to do fasting.

            <p>
              Kaffarah is compensation paid for unfulfilled nazar or sin
              committed. Kaffarah is paid by opting to feed or clothe ten poor
              people. Kaffarah payment can be made to religious bodies of
              authorities such as State Islamic Religious Council. If a person
              is unable to pay the three kaffarah stated, then he has to fast
              for three days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another type of Kaffarah is Kaffarah on couple who have sexual
              intercourse during daytime on Ramadhan. The kaffarah is on the
              husband to free a slave or to fast two months straight or lastly
              to feed 60 poor people.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Kaffarah has not been settled during lifetime, it is a debt
              to Allah that should be settled and may be taken from one’s
              estate.

              When someone cannot fast in Ramadhan and can’t make up the lost

              condition or if she is pregnant and concerned on her baby), then
              they should pay (Fidyah) for someone else to be fed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Fidyah has not been settled during lifetime, it is a debt

            <p>
              Zakat is translated from the Arabic term which means growth,
              multiplicity, or increase. The foundation of Islam is held up by
              the five pillars, and Zakat forms the third pillar. It refers to
              the determined share of wealth prescribed by Allah s.w.t, to be
              distributed to the eight groups of beneficiaries (asnaf). It is a
              form of worship (ibadah) in terms of wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Zakat has not been settled during lifetime, it is a debt to
              Allah that should be settled and may be taken from one’s estate.

              Charity is voluntary provision of assistance to those in need,
              serves as a humanitarian act, and is unmotivated by self-interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Muslim, the term Sadaqah is used for the same. Muslim can
              indicate a Sadaqah amount and gain reward beyond the grave and
              that amount to a maximum of 1/3 of the estate. If it’s more than
              ⅓, all beneficiaries of the estate have to agree on the amount for
              it to be distributed.

            <p>
              Waqaf is a sustainable and ongoing charitable fund and commonly
              called sadaqah jariyah which is defined as an act of voluntarily
              making a long-term charitable contribution that will continue to
              benefit others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout Islamic history, waqaf has contributed to the
              construction of mosques, schools, universities and scientific
              institutions around the world, as well as the associated expenses
              of such facilities, including student accommodation and teachers’
              salaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              As long as the Waqaf asset exists, the reward will continuously
              flow. Muslim can indicate a Waqaf amount or asset and gain reward
              beyond the grave and that amount to a maximum of 1/3 of the
              estate. If it’s more than ⅓, all beneficiaries of the estate have
              to agree on the amount for it to be distributed.

              Organ donation is a noble practice. It is not new in Malaysia as
              it is a treatment method that has been accepted in our country.
              The number of patients who need organ transplants is increasing
              from year to year, but the number of pledgers who want to donate
              after death is low.
            </p>
            <p>
              Organ donation is strictly managed by Ministry of Health via the
              National Transplant Resource Centre which serves as a central
              donor registry and keeps a database of all potential donors.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more information on organ donation, you can visit the website
              of the National Transplant Resource Centre at
              www.dermaorgan.gov.my or call toll free 1-800-88-9080 or email to{' '}

              Fatwa regarding organ transplantation was issued in 1970 by the
              National Fatwa Council. The fatwa is used as reference for matters
              pertaining to organ transplantation and donation in Malaysia, and
              is adopted by states which do not have a specific fatwa regarding
              the issue. States with their own fatwa regarding organ
              transplantation and donation are Perlis (1965), Sarawak (1996),
              Selangor (2000), Johor (2001), and Penang (2010).

            <p>
              Sampul is inspired by the authentic Hadith recorded in Sahih
              Bukhari narrated by Abdullah bin Umar:
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>
                Allah's Messenger said, "It is not permissible for any Muslim
                who has something to will to stay for two nights without having
                his last wasiat and testament written and kept ready with him."
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective of having a wasiat is to ensure that no asset is
              left behind during the distribution process after demise. It is
              also used to state wishes for loved ones including the method on
              how the asset is to be distributed and donated to sadaqah or
              waqaf.
            </p>
            <p>
              All assets and wishes in Sampul may be executed provided all
              beneficiaries do not object to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shariah ruling of wasiat is that consent is not required if
              wasiat is only 1/3 of the estate. If it exceeds, other
              beneficiaries' consent is required.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, Sampul adopted the concept of Takharuj. The word
              Takharuj is taken from the Arabic word Kharaja which means exit.
              In the context of estate planning, it means withdrawal from
              accepting the share of the estate either partially or wholly by
              giving its share to a person or several persons or all other
              beneficiaries.

            <p>
              Yes. In Malaysia, a wasiat is governed by the Shariah Law and a
              non-Muslim Will is governed by the Wills Act 1959.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Wasiat format is designed to be efficient and straightforward
              to help expedite the legal process for probate, letter of
              administration and Faraid certificate application ensuring no
              asset is left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Will, according to Malaysia's Wills Act 1959, you can write
              your own will as long as you meet the following criteria.
            </p>
            <ul>

              <li>Be of sound mind.</li>
