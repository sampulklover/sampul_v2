    individual or corporation, authorised by you to deal with your
    assets and should be experienced, independent, trustworthy and
    impartial so as to ensure proper administration and distribution
    of your estate. Appoint the Guardian of your minor children (below 18 years of
      age) or special child. The Guardian will be the primary
      caretaker of your children who's responsible for their
      well-being. To ensure that the distribution of your estate will be fast and

      possible erosion of the value of your estate. For non-Muslims in Malaysia, the distribution of assets and

        The number of patients who need organ transplants is increasing

        after death is low. Organ donation is strictly managed by Ministry of Health via the
        National Transplant Resource Centre which serves as a central
        donor registry and keeps a database of all potential donors. For more information on organ donation, you can visit the website
        of the National Transplant Resource Centre at
        www.dermaorgan.gov.my or call toll free 1-800-88-9080 or email to ntrc@moh.gov.my. Fatwa regarding organ transplantation was issued in 1970 by the
        National Fatwa Council. The fatwa is used as reference for matters
        pertaining to organ transplantation and donation in Malaysia, and
        is adopted by states which do not have a specific fatwa regarding
        the issue. States with their own fatwa regarding organ

        Bukhari narrated by Abdullah bin Umar: Allah's Messenger said, "It is not permissible for any Muslim
        who has something to will to stay for two nights without having
        his last wasiat and testament written and kept ready with him." The objective of having a wasiat is to ensure that no asset is
        left behind during the distribution process after demise. It is
        also used to state wishes for loved ones including the method on
        how the asset is to be distributed and donated to sadaqah or
        waqaf. All assets and wishes in Sampul may be executed provided all
        beneficiaries do not object to it. The Shariah ruling of wasiat is that consent is not required if
        wasiat is only 1/3 of the estate. If it exceeds, other
        beneficiaries' consent is required. In addition, Sampul adopted the concept of Takharuj. The word
        Takharuj is taken from the Arabic word Kharaja which means exit.
        In the context of estate planning, it means withdrawal from
        accepting the share of the estate either partially or wholly by
        giving its share to a person or several persons or all other
